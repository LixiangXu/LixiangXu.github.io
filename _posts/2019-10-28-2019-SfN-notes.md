# Notes for 2019 SfN
## 1. Spatiotemporal dynamics of sound representations in the human brain
by **M.X. Lowe**
use similarity-based fusion of human MEG and fMRI responses from sounds of human voices, animals, objects, and spaces to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of sound processing in the human brain.

## 2. Attentional modulation of articulatory and semantic representations during multi-speaker natural speech perception
by **Ibrahim Kiremitci**
we recorded whole-brain BOLD responses during a cocktail-party task. We measured voxel-wise selectivity for spectral, articulatory and semantic features of natural speech. We examined the attention modulation in selectivity for these features across cortex. We found that the attention index i smallest at Heschl's Gyrus in the left hemisphere and Plaum Temporale in the right hemisphere.

## 3. # scene-selective brain regions show a posterior-anterior gradient for representing perceptual and conceptual information
by **Naail Khan**
