# Notes for 2019 SfN
## 1. Spatiotemporal dynamics of sound representations in the human brain
by **M.X. Lowe**<br/>
use similarity-based fusion of human MEG and fMRI responses from sounds of human voices, animals, objects, and spaces to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of sound processing in the human brain.

## 2. Attentional modulation of articulatory and semantic representations during multi-speaker natural speech perception
by **Ibrahim Kiremitci**<br/>
we recorded whole-brain BOLD responses during a cocktail-party task. We measured voxel-wise selectivity for spectral, articulatory and semantic features of natural speech. We examined the attention modulation in selectivity for these features across cortex. We found that the attention index i smallest at Heschl's Gyrus in the left hemisphere and Plaum Temporale in the right hemisphere.

## 3. Scene-selective brain regions show a posterior-anterior gradient for representing perceptual and conceptual information
by **Naail Khan**<br/>
how and where in the brain the neural signals associated with perceptual and conceptual processes are integrated in scene identification. Using univariate fMRI analysis, we previously demonstrated that scene-selective regions are activated by both pictures of real-world scenes and words denoting scenes. Here we demonstrate that scence-selective regions are functionally heterogeneous, showing a perceptual-to-conceptual dissociation along a posterior-to-anterior gradient.

## 4. Task-dependent population-level representations of choice and memory in human medial frontal cortex
by **Juri Minxha**<br/>
We focus on choices to identical stimuli that instead depend on switching between two types of an internal representation: image categorization (high level semantic knowledge) and recognition memory (decalative memory). Our goal is to evaluate how the neural representations of the relevant variables (image category, familiarity and choice) are affected by the taks. Our results argue that MTL representations continue to learn about the stimuli independent of the task, whereas MFC represenattions dynamically represent the current task demands and the variables that are necessary to carry out that task.

## 5. The effects of motivated forgetting on contextual memory
by **Stas Kozak**<br/>
Modification of memory for contextual information could influence impaired memory retrieval and generalization. We found that motivated forgetting modifies not only the content of the memory, but also its context.

## 6. High-order brain network dynamics support cognitive processing
by **Lucy Owen**<br/>
we developed a model of neural dynamics that takes in a feature timeseries and outputs estimated first-ordernetwork dynamics(dynamic functional correlations), second-order network dynamics(homologous netwkrs that dynamically form and disperse), and higher-order network dynamics. We found that, classifiers that incorporated second-order correlations yielded consitently higher accuracy that training on lower-order patterns. We also applied dimensionality reduction to the activity patterns, we sought to understand the dimensionality of the neural patterns taht were sufficient to decode.
