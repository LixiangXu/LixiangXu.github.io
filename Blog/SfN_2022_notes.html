                    <h2>The neural computations underlying the relation between freezing and approach avoidance decisions under threat</h2>
                    <h3>by <span class="name">F. H. Klaassen</span></h3>
                    <p>They use human fMRI to study how bradycardia modulates nural pathways underlying value-based computations. By modulating activity in brain regions involved in threat PAG, value integration dACC and/or switching to action pgACC, they observed increased approach vs avoid choices for higher money vs shock amounts.</p>

                    <h2>Reduced neucleus accumbens activity is associated with costly fearful avoidance behavior in humans</h2>
                    <h3>by <span class="name">A. M. Hulsman</span></h3>
                    <p>They designed Fearful Avoidance Task (FAT) to study approach-avoidance conflict. fMRI data and parametric modulation analysis showed that increased reward was associated with increased risky approach behaviour and increased activity in the dACC, neucleus accumbens, PAG, and amygdala, And reduced neucleus accumbens activity in predicted decisions to avoid.</p>

                    <h2>Deconstructing emotion regulation: a system-identification approach using Bayes factors</h2>
                    <h3>by <span class="name">Ke Bo</span></h3>
                    <p>They used a systems identification approach to study reappraisal-appraisal processed that occurs when generating emotions. fMRI + Bayes factors identified regions matching reappraisal-only (in anterior PFC, temporal-parietal junction and temporal pole), common appraisal (in fronto-parietal cortex, insula, lateral and medial pfc) and emotion generations-related regions (amygdala, PAG, parabrachial complex, and thalamus).</p>

                    <h2>Intracranial electrophysiological evidence for a novel neurocomputational mechanism of exploration-exploitation decision-making in humans</h2>
                    <h3>by <span class="name">Xinyuan Yan</span></h3>
                    <p>They used ECoG to study different PFC regions (OFC, mPFC, ACC) responding to multiple chaning rewards and decision-value updating. They used Morlet wavelet convolution analysis to obtain the induced power of each trial then fit choice behavior with RL model. They found that, the gamma band tracked the trial-based exploit value in prefrontal regions prior to choice, and theta band after trial-feadback tracked the potential to obtain a reward from exploration.</p>
